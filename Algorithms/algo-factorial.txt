                Algorithm - Calculate the factorial of a number  

Input: A single integer number from the user  
Output: Display the factorial of the entered number  
Data Structure: Integer variable to store the result and loop counter  

Steps:-

1: Start  
2: Print "Enter a number:"  
3: Read num // num is the number entered by the user  
4: Initialize result ← 1 // Factorial of 0 is 1  
5: For i from 1 to num do  
   5.1: result ← result * i // Multiply result by the current number  
6: EndFor  
7: Print "Factorial of", num, "is", result  
8: Stop
