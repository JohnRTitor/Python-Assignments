Algorithm - Rohmbus Shape Pattern  

Input: Number of rows entered by the user  
Output: A rohmbus pattern of stars printed on the console  

Steps:-

1. Start  
2. Read rows
3. For the upper half of the rohmbus do
   3.1. Iterate `i` from 0 to `rows - 1`  
   3.2. Print spaces (`rows - i - 1`) times for alignment  
   3.3. Print stars (`2 * i + 1`) times in the same row  
   3.4. Move to the next line  
4. For the lower half of the rohmbus do
   4.1. Iterate `i` from `rows - 1` to 1 (in reverse order)  
   4.2. Print spaces (`rows - i`) times for alignment  
   4.3. Print stars (`2 * i - 1`) times in the same row  
   4.4. Move to the next line  
5. Stop
