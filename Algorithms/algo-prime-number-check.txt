                Algorithm - Check if a number is prime  

Input: A single integer number from the user  
Output: Display whether the number is prime or composite  
Data Structure: Integer variable for input and a flag for tracking primality

Steps:-

1: Start  
2: Print "Enter a number:"  
3: Read num // num is the number entered by the user  
4: Initialize flag ← True // Flag variable to determine if the number is prime  
5: If num is 0 or 1 then  
   5.1: Set flag ← False // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers  
6: EndIf  
7: For i from 2 to (num / 2) do  
   7.1: If num % i == 0 then  
       7.1.1: Set flag ← False // num has a divisor, so it's composite  
       7.1.2: Break the loop  
   7.2: EndIf  
8: EndFor  
9: If flag = True then  
   9.1: Print "The number is a prime number."  
10: Else  
   10.1: Print "The number is a composite number."  
11: EndIf  
12: Stop
