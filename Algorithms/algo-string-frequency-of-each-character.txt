            Algorithm - Character Frequency Counter  

Input: A string entered by the user  
Output: Display the frequency of each character in the string  
Data Structure: Dictionary  

Steps:-

1: Start  
2: Print "Enter a string:"  
3: Read input_string // String entered by the user  
4: Convert input_string to lowercase  
5: Initialize an empty dictionary char_freq ‚Üê {}  
6: For each character ch in input_string do  
   6.1: If ch is not in char_freq then  
        6.1.1: Add ch to char_freq with value 1  
   6.2: Else // If ch is already in char_freq  
        6.2.1: Increment char_freq[ch] by 1  
7: EndFor  
8: Print "Characters present and their frequency:"  
9: For each key-value pair ch, freq in char_freq do  
   9.1: Print ch, ":", freq  
10: EndFor  
11: Stop
