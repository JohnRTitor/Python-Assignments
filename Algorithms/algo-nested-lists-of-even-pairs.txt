                Algorithm - Store and display even pairs from user input  

Input: Number of pairs and the pairs themselves, entered by the user  
Output: Display the pairs where both numbers are even  
Data Structure: Nested list to store pairs  

Steps:-

1: Start  
2: Initialize nested_list ← [] // To store the pairs  
3: Print "Enter the number of pairs:"  
4: Read n // Number of pairs to be entered by the user  
5: For i from 0 to n-1 do  
   5.1: Print "Enter a pair:"  
   5.2: Read pair // Convert the user input into a list of two integers  
   5.3: Append pair to nested_list  
6: EndFor  
7: Print "Even pairs:"  
8: For each pair in nested_list do  
   8.1: If pair[0] % 2 == 0 and pair[1] % 2 == 0 then  
       8.1.1: Print pair // Print the pair if both numbers are even  
   8.2: EndIf  
9: EndFor  
10: Stop
