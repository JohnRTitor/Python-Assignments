                Algorithm - Find GCD and LCM of Two Numbers

Input: Two positive integers from the user  
Output: Display the GCD and LCM of the given numbers  

Steps:-

1: Start  
2: Print "Enter the first number:"  
3: Read num1
4: Print "Enter the second number:"  
5: Read num2  
6: If num1 ≤ 0 OR num2 ≤ 0 then  
    6.1: Print "Please enter positive numbers"  
    6.2: Stop  
7: EndIf  
8: Initialize i ← 1, gcd ← 1 // i is a loop counter, gcd stores the greatest common divisor  
9: While i ≤ num1 AND i ≤ num2 do  
    9.1: If num1 % i = 0 AND num2 % i = 0 then  
        9.1.1: gcd ← i  
    9.2: EndIf  
    9.3: i ← i + 1  
10: EndWhile  
11: Calculate lcm ← (num1 * num2) // gcd // lcm stores the least common multiple  
12: Print "GCD of num1 and num2 is gcd"  
13: Print "LCM of num1 and num2 is lcm"  
14: Stop
