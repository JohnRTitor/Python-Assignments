                Algorithm - Calculate the perimeter and area of a circle  

Input: The radius of the circle from the user  
Output: Display the perimeter and area of the circle  
Data Structure: Integer variable for radius and perimeter, area  

Steps:-

1: Start  
2: Print "Enter the radius:"  
3: Read radius // radius is the radius of the circle entered by the user  
4: Calculate perimeter ← 2 * 3.14 * radius // Formula for perimeter  
5: Calculate area ← 3.14 * (radius ** 2) // Formula for area  
6: Print "The perimeter is", perimeter  
7: Print "The area is", area  
8: Stop
