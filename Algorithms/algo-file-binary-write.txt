                Algorithm - Save Student Data in a Binary File, Retrieve from the Binary File and Display Toppers

Input: Path of the binary file, student names, and total marks from the user  
Output: Display the toppers (students with marks greater than 500)  
Data Structure: Dictionary to store student names and marks  

Steps:-

1: Start  
2: Print "Enter the path of the text file:"  
3: Read file_path // file_path holds the path to the binary file  
4: file ← open(file_path, write-binary)
5: Initialize an empty dictionary student_data
6: For each student do
    6.1: Read full_name, total_marks
    6.2: student_data[full_name] ← total_0marks
7: EndFor
8: save(file, student_data)
9: close(file)
10: file ← open(file_path, read-binary)
11: student_data ← read(file)
12: Print "Toppers (with scores > 500): "
13: For each student in student_data do
    13.1: If student.total_marks > 500 then
        13.1.1: Print student.name, student.total_marks
    13.2: EndIf
14: Stop
