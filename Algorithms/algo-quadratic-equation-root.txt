				Algorithm - Solve a quadratic equation  

Input: Coefficients a, b, and c of the quadratic equation  
Output: Display the roots of the equation  
Data Structure: Integer variables for coefficients a, b, c, and roots  

Steps:-

1: Start  
2: Print "Enter a:"  
3: Read a // a is the coefficient of x² in the quadratic equation  
4: Print "Enter b:"  
5: Read b // b is the coefficient of x in the quadratic equation  
6: Print "Enter c:"  
7: Read c // c is the constant term in the quadratic equation  
8: Calculate discriminant ← b² - 4 * a * c // Formula for discriminant  
9: If discriminant < 0 then  
   9.1: Print "No real roots available."  
   9.2: Stop  
10: EndIf  
11: Calculate root1 ← (- b + √discriminant) / (2 * a) // First root using quadratic formula  
12: Calculate root2 ← (- b - √discriminant) / (2 * a) // Second root using quadratic formula  
13: If discriminant > 0 then  
   13.1: Print "Roots are:", root1, ",", root2  
14: Else  
   14.1: Print "Only root is:", root1  
15: EndIf  
16: Stop
