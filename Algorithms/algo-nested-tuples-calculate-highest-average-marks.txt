                Algorithm - Determine the student with the highest average marks  

Input: Number of students and their marks in six subjects  
Output: Display the student with the highest average marks  
Data Structure: Tuple to store each student's marks and average  

Steps:-

1: Start  
2: Print "Enter the number of students:"  
3: Read count_student // Number of students  
4: Initialize tup ← () // Empty tuple to store marks and average for each student  
5: Initialize max_avg ← 0 // Variable to track the highest average marks  
6: For i from 0 to count_student - 1 do  
   6.1: Print "Student", i + 1  
   6.2: Read ben_marks // Marks in Bengali  
   6.3: Read eng_marks // Marks in English  
   6.4: Read math_marks // Marks in Math  
   6.5: Read phy_marks // Marks in Physics  
   6.6: Read chem_marks // Marks in Chemistry  
   6.7: Read bio_marks // Marks in Biology  
   6.8: Calculate avg_marks ← (ben_marks + eng_marks + math_marks + phy_marks + chem_marks + bio_marks) / 6  
   6.9: If avg_marks > max_avg then  
        6.9.1: Update max_avg ← avg_marks  
        6.9.2: Update topper ← i  
   6.10: EndIf  
   6.11: Append (ben_marks, eng_marks, math_marks, phy_marks, chem_marks, bio_marks, avg_marks) to tup  
7: EndFor  
8: Print "Student with highest average marks:"  
9: Print "Student", topper + 1, "with average marks", max_avg  
10: Stop
