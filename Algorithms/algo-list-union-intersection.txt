                Algorithm - Find the union and intersection of two lists  

Input: Two lists of numbers entered by the user  
Output: Display the union and intersection of the two lists  
Data Structure: Two input lists, one list for union, and one list for intersection  

Steps:-

1: Start  
2: Print "Enter list1:"  
3: Read list1 // Convert the user input into a list of integers  
4: Print "Enter list2:"  
5: Read list2 // Convert the user input into a list of integers  
6: Initialize union_list ← [] // To store the union of the two lists  
7: Initialize intersection_list ← [] // To store the intersection of the two lists  
8: For each x in list1 do  
    8.1: If x is in list2 then  
        8.1.1: Append x to intersection_list // Add common element to intersection  
    8.2: Else  
        8.2.1: Append x to union_list // Add unique element from list1 to union  
    8.3: EndIf  
9: EndFor  
10: For each x in list2 do  
    10.1: Append x to union_list // Add all elements of list2 to union  
11: EndFor  
12: Print "Union:", union_list  
13: Print "Intersection:", intersection_list  
14: Stop
