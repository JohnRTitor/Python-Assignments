            Algorithm - Check if a number is a perfect number  

Input: A single integer number from the user  
Output: Display whether the number is a perfect number or not  
Data Structure: Integer variable for input and sum of divisors  

Steps:-

1: Start  
2: Print "Enter a number:"  
3: Read num // num is the number entered by the user  
4: Initialize sum ← 0 // To store the sum of divisors  
5: For i from 1 to num-1 do  
   5.1: If num % i == 0 then  
      5.1.1: Add i to sum  
   5.2: EndIf  
6: EndFor  
7: If sum == num then  
   7.1: Print num, "is a perfect number."  
8: Else  
   8.1: Print num, "is not a perfect number."  
9: EndIf  
10: Stop
